# Indian-State-EDA
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of various Indian states, aiming to uncover insights related to demographic, economic, and social indicators. The project involves analyzing key datasets to explore patterns, trends, and relationships across different states, helping in better decision-making and policy planning.

# Project Goals
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for accurate analysis.
- Conduct descriptive statistical analysis to summarize key data points.
- Visualize data using graphs, charts to identify trends and disparities across states.
- Explore relationships between different variables (e.g.population etc.)
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the findings.

# Key Steps:
**Data Loading & Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming the data for analysis.

**Descriptive Statistics:** Summary of major features in the dataset (mean, median, mode etc.)

**Data Visualization:** Using plots like histograms, bar charts, scatter plots visualize the state-wise data.

**Correlation Analysis:** Identifying relationships.

**State-wise Comparisons:** Analyzing regional disparities and trends in various indicators.

# Tools & Libraries Used:
 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
